“Onéguine, all this sumptuousness,
   The gilding of life’s vanities,
   In the world’s vortex my success,
   My splendid house and gaieties—
   What are they? Gladly would I yield
   This life in masquerade concealed,
   This glitter, riot, emptiness,
   For my wild garden and bookcase,—
   Yes! for our unpretending home,
   Onéguine—the beloved place
   Where the first time I saw your face,—
   Or for the solitary tomb
   Wherein my poor old nurse doth lie
   Beneath a cross and shrubbery.

   “’Twas possible then, happiness—
   Nay, near—but destiny decreed—
   My lot is fixed—with thoughtlessness
   It may be that I did proceed—
   With bitter tears my mother prayed,
   And for Tattiana, mournful maid,
   Indifferent was her future fate.
   I married—now, I supplicate—
   For ever your Tattiana leave.
   Your heart possesses, I know well,
   Honour and pride inflexible.
   I love you—to what end deceive?—
   But I am now another’s bride—
   For ever faithful will abide.”

   She rose—departed. But Eugene
   Stood as if struck by lightning fire.
   What a storm of emotions keen
   Raged round him and of balked desire!
   And hark! the clank of spurs is heard
   And Tania’s husband soon appeared.—
   But now our hero we must leave
   Just at a moment which I grieve
   Must be pronounced unfortunate—
   For long—for ever. To be sure
   Together we have wandered o’er
   The world enough. Congratulate
   Each other as the shore we climb!
   Hurrah! it long ago was time!
